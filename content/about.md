# About Me

&nbsp;  
Hi, I'm Charlotte! I'm from the UK.     

I'm a critical illness survivor and PhD drop-out on a journey to retrain as a software developer. My background is in Environmental Science with an interest in natural resource extraction. 

I'm happiest in the mountains, addicted to trail running and have too ~~many~~ few cats. Passionate about the environment, mental health and standing desks. Read occasionally, watch movies often and dance to 80s music always.
