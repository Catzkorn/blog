Dev blogs are great way to communicate projects you are working on, and to read and learn about what others are doing too. They can also be used to journal the professional (and the personal) highs, lows and challenges that are faced.

A really simple way to achieve a professional looking website, without paying for the privilege,is by using a combination of Hugo, Github and Netlify. This is how I am hosting the website you are currently reading and it's total cost is the domain name (and your manhours!). 

   
For this guide, I'm going to assume you have a developer environment and knowledge of using Github,

## Pre-requisites

### Netlify 

To deploy the website, you will need to use [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), so create an account if you don't have one already. 


### Domain

You'll need a domain name. I use [Google domains](https://domains.google.com), it's quick and easy but other sellers are available. 

## Choosing a Theme

The quickest and simplest way to get your site up and running fast is to choose from one of the many free themes available on the internet. 

The positives are you can find a theme to fit your personality and target audience without the hassle of learning copious amounts of HTML, Javascript, CSS and Go templates. The downside is, depending on how much you want to mess about, you may be limited on how much customisation you can do. 

I personally have used [hugo themes](http://themes.gohugo.io/) for this website. My husband, [Johan](https://twitter.com/johanbrandhorst), has kindly allowed me free reign to give his personal dev blog a face lift to for this guide. I'm using the [LoveIt](https://themes.gohugo.io/loveit/) theme by Dillon. 

If you choose a different theme, there will be slight differences in code to account for different design and features. Hopefully this guide will give you enough understanding of the syntax
