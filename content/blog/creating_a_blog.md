Website builders are great for many people. The ease of use and the ability to customize your site without getting technical has allowed many to reach audiences at a reasonable, but not insignificant price.  

 But what happens if you don't mind putting in a bit of extra work, or don't need all the bells and whistles? It is completely possible to host your own personal blog/website for the cost of a domain, often the equivalent or less than one month fee of some of the most popular website creators.    

 This can be achieved a number of ways, but my preference is using a combination of Hugo, Github and Netlify. This is how I am hosting the website you are currently reading. 

Here's a complete walk through on how you too can achieve a website. 


## Software

### editor

You'll need an editor. I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on Mac


## Accounts

### github

 [Github](https://github.com)

### netlify 

[Netlify](https://netlify.com/)


### domain

You'll need a domain name. I use [Google domains](https://domains.google.com), it's quick and easy but other sellers are available. 

## theme

The quickest and simplest way to get your site up and running fast is to choose from one of the many free themes available on the internet. 

The positives are you can find a theme to fit your personality and target audience without the hassle of learning copious amounts of HTML, Javascript, CSS and Go templates. The downside is, depending on how much you want to mess about, you may be limited on how much customisation you can do. 

I personally have used this website for [hugo themes](http://themes.gohugo.io/). My husband, [Johan](https://twitter.com/johanbrandhorst), has kindly allowed me free reign to give his personal dev blog a face lift to for this guide. I'm using the [LoveIt](https://themes.gohugo.io/loveit/) theme by Dillon. 

If you choose a different theme, there will be slight differences in code. Hopefully this guide will give you enough understanding of the syntax
