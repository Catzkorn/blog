      <description>In a previous post I introduced my open source project to bring GopherJS bindings to Improbable&amp;rsquo;s gRPC-Web client. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say that the initial goal of supporting all features of the gRPC-Web client has been completed. I was initially going to leave it at that and wait for client side streaming to land in the WHATWG Streams API Standard, and subsequently added to the official grpc-web spec and probably the gRPC-Web client, but then I was sitting at the GolangUK conference and I had a brain wave.</description>

      <title>gRPC-Web with GopherJS</title>

      <description>In a previous blog series I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about how to work with a gRPC backend from the GopherJS world. It relies on the gRPC-gateway which is a great piece of tech, but unfortunately carries a couple of downsides:
 Clients don&amp;rsquo;t know what types are used - the interface is HTTP JSON. This can be somewhat mitigated with the use of swagger generated interfaces, but it&amp;rsquo;s still not perfect. The interface being JSON means marshalling and unmarshalling can become a significant part of the latency between the client and the server.</description>
