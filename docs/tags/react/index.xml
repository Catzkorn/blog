      <description>In a previous blog series I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about how to work with a gRPC backend from the GopherJS world. It relies on the gRPC-gateway which is a great piece of tech, but unfortunately carries a couple of downsides:
 Clients don&amp;rsquo;t know what types are used - the interface is HTTP JSON. This can be somewhat mitigated with the use of swagger generated interfaces, but it&amp;rsquo;s still not perfect. The interface being JSON means marshalling and unmarshalling can become a significant part of the latency between the client and the server.</description>
