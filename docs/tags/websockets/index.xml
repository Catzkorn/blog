      <description>In a previous post I introduced my open source project to bring GopherJS bindings to Improbable&amp;rsquo;s gRPC-Web client. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say that the initial goal of supporting all features of the gRPC-Web client has been completed. I was initially going to leave it at that and wait for client side streaming to land in the WHATWG Streams API Standard, and subsequently added to the official grpc-web spec and probably the gRPC-Web client, but then I was sitting at the GolangUK conference and I had a brain wave.</description>
