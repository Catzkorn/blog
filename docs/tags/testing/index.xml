      <description>Recently I found myself wondering how I was going to test my new GopherJS gRPC-Web bindings. Writing tests was something I had been waiting with until I had something working, mostly because I had no idea how I was going to meaningfully test GopherJS code that relies on interactions with JS and the reponses of a server.
I have in the past made a small contribution to the GopherJS websocket repo, and found myself impressed with the extensive tests written for the repo.</description>
